## Executive Summary

This white paper introduces **Vega Time Crystal** as a conceptual framework within the 
Resonance Data and QIRC ecosystem.

---

## 1. Introduction

Vega Time Crystal represents a novel contribution to resonance-based meaning systems.

## 2. Definition

**Vega Time Crystal** is a conceptual layer that models meaning as a resonant state 
with temporal coherence.
